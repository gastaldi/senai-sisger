All Use Cases in the system are contained in this package.   This is done strictly as a way to organize the model and make it easier to understand.

See Rational UnifiedProcess:
Activity " Describe the Use Case Model".

In order to version control use cases it is recommended to specify use case packages within this package.

Use Cases are often documented in a separate text file, use the  Rational Unified Process template or use the use case template  in Rational Requsite Pro.

The "Use Case Realizations" that correspond to these use cases  are created in the Design Model..
