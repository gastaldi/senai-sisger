<Enter a short description of the package here.  A package should be used in cases where a set of classes and/or other packages need to be grouped together for model organization purposes.  Though the contents of the package can have public visibility, which makes them visible to model elements outside the containing package, packages are primarily just grouping mechanisms.  

If a set of classes is to be encapsulated and can be hidden behind a well-defined interface, a subsystem is a more appropriate container>
