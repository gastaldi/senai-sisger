Welcome to the Rational Unified Process Frame Work

Purpose of the FrameWork:
a) provide a good structure for a Rose model
b) provide a style guide with naming conventions/suggestions
c) identify a minimal set of diagrams to produce
d) relate activities in RUP to Rose diagrams
e) provide a basis for sophisticated SoDA reports. For instance based on this structure most of the Rose parts of the "Software Architecture Document" are generated from SoDA.
