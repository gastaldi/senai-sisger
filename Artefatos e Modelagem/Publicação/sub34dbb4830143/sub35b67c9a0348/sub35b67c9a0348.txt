The Implementation Model in Rational Unified Process is a collection of components, and the implementation subsystems that contain them.

An architectural view that describes one or several system configurations; the mapping of software components (tasks, modules) to the computing nodes in these configurations.

Defines, executables, dll's, files, subsystems, compilation order etc.

Rational Unified Process:
Activity: Define the Organization of Subsystems

These diagram will be presented in the  Implementation  View section in the document generated using the SoDA Software Architecture Document.

It is recommended that, in most cases, the mapping should be
1:1 between design and implementation, that is, for each package in design there is one subsystem in the implementation model.
