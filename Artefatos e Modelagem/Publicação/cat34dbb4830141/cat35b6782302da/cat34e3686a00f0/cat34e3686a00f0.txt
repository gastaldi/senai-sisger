The design model is normally organized in layers. The number of layers is not fixed, but varies from situation to situation. 

During architectural analysis, focus is normally on the two high-level layers, that is, the application and business-specific layers;  this is what is meant by the "high-level organization of subsystems." The other lower-level layers are in focus during architectural design, refer to the activity Architectural Design for more information.

Layers are identified using the naming conventions shown in the name of this package.
