Business services respond to requests from the user (or other business services) in order to execute a business task. They accomplish this by requesting the data services needed and applying formal procedures and business rules to the relevant data. This protocol insulates the user from direct interaction with the database. Because business rules tend to change more frequently than the specific business tasks they support, they are ideal candidates for encapsulating in components that are physically separate from the application logic itself.
